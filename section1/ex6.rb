# Study Drills
# 1) Comment above each line explaining (done)
# 2) Find all places where string is put inside a string: 5 (done)
# 3) Are you sure there are only four places? no (done)
# 4) Explain why adding two strings w and e with + makes a longer strings
     # because w and e are strings individually that have been added
# 5) What happens when you change the strings to use ' (single quote)' instead of ""?: nothing (done)
        # Do they still work/ guess why?: They do still work, I believe because it's to prevent progammers from finding excess errors if only one type of quote was used.
