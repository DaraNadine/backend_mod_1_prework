1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
I've tried traditional Pomodoro in the past and it was easy to decide something else took precedence during the break. Thus me ignoring any remainder of work I intended to do.
So I tweaked my Pom's by listing my entire waking day in 30 minute increments in a journal. I've color coded daily activities and I naturally tend to look at the time every hour. Studies = green, chores/appt's =  blue, projects = purple, and internet scrolling/tv = black
Every 30 minutes I color in the corresponding block according to it's assigned activity color. This way I can see where my entire day goes instead of only keeping track of one thing. It's much easier to stick to a goal when I make it more tangible and so far this was my most successful week.

My estimated times were way off. Overall I spent less time on the work than I thought however my reading and studying lasted much longer than I anticipated.
But I felt that I was more focused in general.

1. In your own words, what is a Class?
An overarching category or blueprint for objects

1. What is an attribute of a Class?
The concrete things: an object that holds information

1. What is behavior of a Class?
What those objects are capable of doing.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:
```rb
 class Dog
  attr_accessor :name, :breed, :age, :fetches, :

  def initialize(name)
     @name = name
  end

  def age(number)
    @age = age
  end

  def breed(type)
    @breed = breed
  end
end

  winston = dog.new
  winston.name = "Winston"
  winston.breed = "Boston Terrier"
  winston.age(13)
```

1. How do you create an instance of a class?
Instances are also called variables aka a subset of the class

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?
Why are there so many words and terminology that mean the same thing?
bout classes in Ruby?
