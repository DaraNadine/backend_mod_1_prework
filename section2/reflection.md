## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I tend to take way too long to ask questions in the context of online school. In my past experiences I've been naturally good at things or had access to immediate feedback which alleviated any anxiety I had of asking a question. I can ask the dumbest questions easily in person. When I have to wait for a reply back via email or slack then I try to avoid doing so. It's something I have worked on these past months and I feel that I've made great strides with lately.

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
It's a statement that's written in a (hypothesis then conclusion)
if sandals > boots
  puts "There are more pairs of sandals than boots."
end
if sandals < boots
  puts "Woah that's a lot of boots."
end
if sandals == boots
  puts "You have a lot of shoes!"
end

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
When there are multiple outcomes possible and you want to allocate an answer to each outcome scenario.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if conditional [then]
  code...
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
With elseif and else.

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
if conditional [then]
  code...
[elsif conditional [then]
  code...]...
end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
else :
if conditional [then]
  code...
[elsif conditional [then]
  code...]...
[else
  code...]
end

### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
A method consists of a name, block of code, input and output. The purpose is to achieve what the argument(s) outcome that it's trying to achieve.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello
  puts

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
